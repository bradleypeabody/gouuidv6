"Version 6" UUIDs in Go
=======================

NOTE: This implementation is a prototype from a few years ago.  There is an update proposal at https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-peabody-dispatch-new-uuid-format and the outcome of that proposal will determine what happens with this project.

See https://bradleypeabody.github.io/uuidv6/ for an explanation of 
'Version 6' UUIDs.
